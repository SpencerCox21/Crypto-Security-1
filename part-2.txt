Making a Cipher


My cipher will be this below.

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ! ? . , 

z u v w x y p q r s t k l m n o f g h i j a b c d e 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 ? ! , .


My cipher takes the alphabet and reverse's it, however it does that in increments of 5 so v-z is changed to a-e.
However since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, z was left over... so I just put it in the front so a is changed to z.
I then did the same with numbers 0-9 so that numbers would be included.
I then swapped ?-! and ,-. just to make sure some punctuation would be added in there.
